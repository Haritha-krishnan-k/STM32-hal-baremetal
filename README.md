# STM32 GPIO Practice (Bare Metal + HAL)

This repository contains step-by-step STM32 GPIO examples
implemented using both HAL and register-level programming.

## Projects

01. GPIO Toggle Pin (HAL)
02. GPIO Read Pin (HAL)
03. GPIO Register Level LED Control
04. GPIO Register Level Button Read
05. GPIO Register Level Button Control using BSRR

## Board
- STM32 (Nucleo)
- LED: PA5
- Button: PC13

## Goal
To understand STM32 GPIO from HAL abstraction
down to bare-metal register manipulation.
